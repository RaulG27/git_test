    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><em>New York-style pizza is known for its thin, foldable crust, large slices, and simple yet flavorful toppings like tomato sauce and whole milk mozzarella cheese. 
        These pizzas are often cooked in very hot ovens, which results in a slightly charred and crispy bottom, while the slices are served in a classic "fold and eat" style. 
        New York-style pizza is a beloved, iconic dish available both by the slice and as whole pies, emphasizing the quality of ingredients and a balance of flavors, 
        with variations like white pizza and Sicilian pizza also in the mix.</em>
